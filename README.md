  This algorithm differentiates between horizontal or vertical orientation of a matrix, it resizes one of the two dimensions to fit a ratio of 16:9 (horizontal) or 9:16 (vertical) depending on the initial orientation, the difference between the original value and the adjusted one gives an even value to be correctly centered with respect to the original matrix (there are two spaces between the adjusted value with respect to the initial value).
